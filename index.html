        <p>My name is Isaac Beverly, and I am from Durham, NC.  I am a <strong>Christian</strong>, a husband 
            of an amazing wife, and father of two children.  I have a strong interest in 
            programming, and my goal is to become a software engineer and to potentially learn
            cybersecurity as well.</p>
        <p>My story is one that has required <strong>grit</strong> and <strong>determination</strong>.  I am a graduate from The 
            University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with two separate degrees in Dramatic Arts
            and Communication with a focus in Performance Studies.  I have also be a personal trainer
            an actor, and an associate pastor in my life, and I currently have worked my way up to be a Captain (Manager)
            at Chick-fil-A.  Chick-fil-A has developed my <span style="color:blueviolet;">leadership skills, interpersonal skills,
            and my work ethic</span>, and it is in this context that I have also become a <strong>self-taught programmer
            with a great desire to serve others.</strong></p>

        <p>One accomplishment that I have achieved (God Willing) is becoming a self-taught programmer.
            <span style="color: blueviolet; background-color:aquamarine;">I have done this using a bootcamp course by The Software Guild while working full-time as a 
            Captain at Chick-fil-A and being a husband and father.</span></p>
        <p>Another accomplishment that I have achieved is becoming <strong>valedictorian</strong> of
            my high school class and beig on the Dean's List at The University of North Carolina at Chapel
            Hill.</p>

        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
        <a href="index.html"><img src="images/thomasaquinas350x510.jpg" alt="stained glass with thomas aquinas"/></a> 
         <p>Outside of work, you can find me studying theology and philosophy; I like to gain deep
            understandings of <strong>truth</strong> and to truly grasp concepts that can at times be quite difficult to
            understand.  I love to <strong>learn </strong>new things.</p>
        <p>Another hobby that I pursue is juggling.  Though I am a beginner in this art, it is an 
            interesting activity that has captured my imagination that I hope to improve at.  I also
            enjoy working out using kettlebells and calisthenics.</p>
